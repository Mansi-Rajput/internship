#### TASK ####
# Description: Implement a class decorator to log method calls within a class.
# Task: Create a decorator log_methods that logs the entry and exit of every method call within a class.

#### Note ####
# Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. 
# The softwareâ€™s developer adds logging calls to their code to indicate that certain events have occurred. 
# An event is described by a descriptive message which can optionally contain variable data 
# (i.e. data that is potentially different for each occurrence of the event). 
# Events also have an importance which the developer ascribes to the event; the importance can also be called the level or severity.
